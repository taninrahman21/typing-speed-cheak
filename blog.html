      <h2>Defference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h2>
      <p>SessionStorage is similar to localStorage.The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>
